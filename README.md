# Todo
This repository (and Android app) was solely created to try out the new support for RxJava in Realm.

## About
The app shows a todo list. Remember that you shouldn't use this app though, as it's just a sample app.

## Libraries used
* AppCompat, CardView and RecyclerView
* Realm
* RxJava and RxAndroid
* ButterKnife
* Timber

## Things to come
* Add todo feature
* Delete todo feature
* Edit todo feature
* Rewrite/refactor from Java to Kotlin

Basically just CRUD stuff, except the part about rewriting it to Kotlin.
